      <h2>GTAW </h2>
      <p> GTAW stands for Gas Tungsten Arc Welding, commonly known as TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding. It is a precise and versatile welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld and a shielding gas to protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination. 
Here's an overview of the GTAW/TIG welding process:
	Equipment: The primary equipment for GTAW/TIG welding includes a welding power source, a TIG torch, a non-consumable tungsten electrode, filler metal (if needed), and a shielding gas supply. The power source generates the electric current required for welding, while the TIG torch directs the flow of shielding gas and holds the tungsten electrode.
	Operation: In GTAW/TIG welding, the non-consumable tungsten electrode is held in the TIG torch and positioned near the joint to be welded. When the welding arc is initiated, the tungsten electrode generates intense heat, which melts the base metal and, if required, a separate filler metal. A shielding gas, typically argon or helium, is directed around the arc to protect the molten weld pool from atmospheric contamination.
	Tungsten Electrode: The tungsten electrode used in GTAW/TIG welding is non-consumable, meaning it does not melt during the welding process. Tungsten is chosen for its high melting point and excellent electrical conductivity. The electrode is often sharpened to a fine point, which helps focus the heat of the arc and improves welding control.
	Filler Metal: In some GTAW/TIG welding applications, a separate filler metal may be added to the weld pool to provide additional material and improve weld strength. The filler metal is usually fed into the weld area manually using a separate filler rod, although automatic feeding systems can also be used.
	Shielding Gas: The shielding gas used in GTAW/TIG welding serves to protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination, such as oxygen and nitrogen, which can cause weld defects. Argon is the most commonly used shielding gas due to its inert properties and excellent arc stability.
	Applications: GTAW/TIG welding is well-suited for welding thin materials and applications that require high-quality welds, such as aerospace components, pressure vessels, piping, and precision fabrication. It can be used to weld a variety of metals, including stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, and copper alloys.
	Advantages: GTAW/TIG welding offers several advantages, including precise control over the welding arc, minimal spatter, high-quality welds with excellent appearance, and the ability to weld a wide range of materials. It is also suitable for welding in all positions, although it is most commonly used in the flat and horizontal positions.
