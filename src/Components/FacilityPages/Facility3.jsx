      <h2>GMAW</h2>
      <p>GMAW stands for Gas Metal Arc Welding, commonly known as MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding. It is a versatile and widely used welding process that utilizes a consumable electrode wire and a shielding gas to create strong, high-quality welds. 
Here's an overview of the GMAW/MIG welding process:
	Equipment: The primary equipment for GMAW/MIG welding includes a welding power source, wire feeder, welding gun or torch, electrode wire, and shielding gas supply. The power source provides the electric current needed for welding, while the wire feeder feeds the consumable electrode wire through the welding gun. The welding gun directs the electrode wire to the weld joint and provides a means for delivering shielding gas.
	Operation: In GMAW/MIG welding, the welding gun is held by the welder and positioned over the joint to be welded. The consumable electrode wire is continuously fed through the gun and into the welding arc. At the same time, a shielding gas, typically a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide or argon and oxygen, is directed around the arc to protect the molten weld pool from atmospheric contamination.
	Shielding Gas: The shielding gas serves two primary purposes: it prevents atmospheric gases such as oxygen and nitrogen from reacting with the molten metal, which could lead to weld defects, and it stabilizes the arc by providing a conductive medium. The composition of the shielding gas can be adjusted depending on the specific requirements of the welding application.
	Wire Electrodes: GMAW/MIG welding utilizes a variety of electrode wires, including solid wire electrodes and flux-cored wire electrodes. Solid wire electrodes are used with a shielding gas, while flux-cored wire electrodes have a flux core that provides gas shielding as it melts, eliminating the need for an external shielding gas.
	Applications: GMAW/MIG welding is suitable for a wide range of materials, including carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and other non-ferrous metals. It is commonly used in industries such as automotive manufacturing, construction, shipbuilding, and fabrication. GMAW/MIG welding can be performed in various welding positions, including flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead.
	Advantages: GMAW/MIG welding offers several advantages, including high welding speeds, excellent weld appearance, minimal spatter, and good control over weld parameters. It is also relatively easy to learn and can be automated for high-volume production.
