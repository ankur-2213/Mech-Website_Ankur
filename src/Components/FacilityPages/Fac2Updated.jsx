        <h1 className='text-[26px] font-semibold'>About SAW:</h1>
        <p className='my-3'>Submerged Arc Welding (SAW) is a high-efficiency welding process widely used in heavy industries. It is known for its deep penetration, high deposition rates, and ability to produce high-quality welds with minimal defects. SAW is commonly used in structural fabrication, shipbuilding, and pipeline construction.</p>

        <h3 className='mt-5 text-[18px] font-semibold'>How SAW Works</h3>
        <p className='my-3'>SAW involves creating an electric arc between a continuously fed consumable electrode and the workpiece. The arc is completely submerged under a blanket of granular flux, which protects the weld pool from atmospheric contamination. As the electrode melts, it fuses with the base metal, forming a strong and uniform weld.</p>

        <h3 className='mt-5 text-[18px] font-semibold'>Key Features of SAW</h3>
        <ul className='list-disc pl-5 my-3'>
          <li><strong>Welding Power Source:</strong> Supplies the necessary electrical current for welding.</li>
          <li><strong>Wire Feeder:</strong> Continuously feeds the electrode into the welding zone.</li>
          <li><strong>Flux Delivery System:</strong> Distributes granular flux over the arc to protect the weld pool.</li>
          <li><strong>Welding Head or Torch:</strong> Guides the electrode and controls the welding arc.</li>
          <li><strong>Conveyor or Travel Mechanism:</strong> Moves the welding head along the joint for automated operation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className='mt-5 text-[18px] font-semibold'>Conclusion</h3>
        <p className='my-3'>SAW is a highly efficient and reliable welding process, particularly suited for thick-section welding in heavy industries. Its ability to produce high-quality, defect-free welds with minimal operator intervention makes it an essential technique in structural and mechanical fabrication.</p>
