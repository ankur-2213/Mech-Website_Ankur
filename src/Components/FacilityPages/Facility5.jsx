      <h2>Oxyfuel welding</h2>
      <p>Oxyfuel welding, also known as oxyacetylene welding, is a welding process that uses the heat produced by a controlled flame generated by the combustion of oxygen and a fuel gas, typically acetylene. 
Here's an overview of the oxyfuel welding process:
	Equipment: The primary equipment for oxyfuel welding includes oxygen and acetylene cylinders, regulators, hoses, a welding torch, and welding rods or filler metal. The oxygen and acetylene cylinders contain compressed gases, which are regulated and delivered to the torch through hoses and regulators. The welding torch mixes the oxygen and acetylene gases in the correct proportions and controls the flame produced.
	Operation: In oxyfuel welding, the torch flame is ignited and adjusted to produce a neutral, carburizing, or oxidizing flame, depending on the welding requirements. A neutral flame is typically used for most welding applications and consists of equal parts oxygen and acetylene, resulting in a well-balanced heat output. A carburizing flame has excess acetylene and is used for welding certain types of metals, while an oxidizing flame has excess oxygen and is used for cutting or welding oxidizable metals.
	Heat Source: The heat produced by the oxyfuel flame is used to melt the base metal and, if necessary, the welding rod or filler metal. The molten metal forms a weld pool, which solidifies to create the weld joint. Oxyfuel welding can be used to weld a variety of metals, including mild steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and copper alloys.
	Filler Metal: Depending on the welding application, filler metal may be added to the weld pool to provide additional material and improve weld strength. The filler metal is typically in the form of welding rods or wire, which are manually fed into the weld area as needed.
	Applications: Oxyfuel welding is commonly used for welding thin materials, such as sheet metal, pipes, and tubes, as well as for repair and maintenance work. It is also used for brazing and soldering applications, where lower temperatures are required to join metals without melting the base material.
	Advantages: Oxyfuel welding offers several advantages, including portability, versatility, and the ability to weld in various positions. It does not require electricity, making it suitable for remote or outdoor welding applications. Additionally, oxyfuel welding equipment is relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain.
	Limitations: Despite its versatility, oxyfuel welding has some limitations, including slower welding speeds compared to other processes, limited penetration depth, and the potential for heat distortion in the base metal. It is also not suitable for welding non-ferrous metals like aluminum or titanium, which require specialized processes such as TIG or MIG welding
